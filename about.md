I am a Software Engineer living in Portland Oregon hoping to keep the dream of the 90s alive with AI and Big Data. Currently
work at Webtrends as a Software Engineer building large scale Big Data systems. I enjoy great beer and music when I am not coding
the night away. Currently trying to apply Machine Learning to the "Big Data" domain and explore scalable learning algorithms.

### Educational and Research Background

MS Computer Science Portland State University 2012 

BS Computing and Software Systems University of Washington Tacoma 2010
