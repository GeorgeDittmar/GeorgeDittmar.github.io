        <title>Text Clustering Part 1: A Document is Multi Dimensional!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This begins the first part of a series on clustering text and more specifically documents using simple features and algorithms. Later
in this series I might touch upon how to do this at a larger scale using Spark or Hadoop. The goal of this series is to get people familiar with
some basic Information Retrieval techniques that are applicable to many domains involving text extracting and learning simple models using textual
information. Part of this motivation also comes from a project I started a year ago to do simple text clustering of documents in plain text
using unsupervised learning techniques. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GeorgeDittmar/TextClustering&quot;&gt;The TextClustering project&lt;/a&gt; was a java project that I started a few years ago to build a framework to do
clustering of text and other natural language processing techniques. It hasnt moved as far as I would have liked due to other interests
and work taking up time, but I might make sure the last of the basic functionality works at least for the purpose of extending this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vector-space-basics&quot;&gt;Vector Space Basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off we need to get some terminology down and understand some underlying mathematics we will be using to ultimately create the document clusters.
First off we need to understand what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model&quot;&gt;Vector Space Model&lt;/a&gt; is and some basic operations we will be performing on such a model.
The linked wiki explains vector space model fairly well but I will try to give a nice summary with an example or two that might make it more clear and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say for instance we have two documents D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which are just 4 word sentences. Our documents D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented as a vector of terms seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (Cash,is,a,cool,dog)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (Chase,puts,up,with,Cash)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vector space model can be thought of as the space where all of these documents “live” given that each term from our document vectors is a dimension inside that space. So for instance
we could rewrite these vectors to be representative of what they should look like when living inside the vector space. We assume that these documents live within a common vector space
which means we can rewrite them to be a series of 0 or 1’s if a term in the vector space is present in the document. So for example our documents then become represented as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector space terms = (a, cash, chase, cool, dog, is, puts, up, with)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1,1,0,1,1,1,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (Chase,puts,up,with,Cash)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We treat the document vectors similar to how we would treat vectors in linear algebra which means we can use the same operations on them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;term-vectors&quot;&gt;Term Vectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off lets define what a term vector is. Basically its a vector of terms. That’s about it. Well its not THAT simple but its easy to think of it that way.
Say we have a document D and we want to get its term vector. Well the term vector of that document could be thought of as D_t = (w1,w2,w3,…,wn), where w1 through wn are all the words found
in that document upto word n. We want these vectors to contain non-zero count terms because it makes no sense to include a term that is not in D in its term vector. Now the values of these w_i elements
can be as simple as the counts of the number of times a word appears in the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;information-retrieval-basics&quot;&gt;Information Retrieval Basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section covers some of the aspects of Information Retrieval that come into play when dealing with processing documents for machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Insert Title Here...</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anxiety is the hand maiden of creativity.
-T. S. Eliot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above quote I think sums up how I feel about my work and putting it out there for others to see. My anxiety when creating new
projects or trying to talk about something with authority to someone drives my thirst for knowledge and wanting to know I am
correct in my understanding of things. This also drives my need to build things on my own and try to implement things with my own creative twist
with the hope that it might be useful for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this blog post isnt going to be about why I do what I do but I wanted it to be an intro to something I started a year ago while job hunting
as a way to keep my brain active and not fall victim to complacency in my skills. So for the next series of posts I will try to describe how to do
simple document clustering using K-Means and K-NN to learn book genre’s. This will also be a good test of how well I know this material, and
how well I can explain my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I’ll give a basic definition of what problem we are wanting to solve and the setup of the the data. Secondly I’ll discuss the algorithms
being used, hopefully with useful citations, that will give some validity to what I am talking about. I am still working out if this will be a
single blog post or multiple smaller posts. I guess we shall see how things go and hopefully this will keep me wanting to post more as I learn new things
or work on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– G&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Back on The Machine Learning Horse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Its time to get serious about where I want to move my career and keep my research skills fresh. Thats why I am attempting to get
back on the Machine Learning horse. Most of this has to do with wanting to expand my employable skill sets but also really
dive into the problems I want to solve now with big data and its application to the ML research field. With the explosion in the
popularity of ML the last 5 years with online MOOCS and roles such as Data Science being found at jobs all over, its hard not to want to get back in on the action! 
I really need to get my focus back to my research roots in ML and just build cool and interesting things that can hopefully expand into work with my current
company or with others. Who knows but now that there are so many tools and resources out there it seems crazy not to try to 
do some self study and research these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current goals will focus around brushing up on my background mathematics that have gotten rusty and their application in
solving many ML algorithms. Hoping to make this blog a nice journal / portfolio of my work towards getting myself where I want
to be and maybe I can teach some other people some stuff as I go through these problems again. One can hope at least :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan of attack is work on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GeorgeDittmar/Scala-NeuralNet&quot;&gt;Scala Neural Net project&lt;/a&gt;, brush up on Linear Algebra and Stats, and build out a reddit bot with a collegue of mine.
Sure is going to be bunch of work but it should be fun. Thats why we are the mad scientists right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– GWD&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello Blog World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well today is the day I start using Jekyll and becoming one of those cool developers who maintains a blog / portfolio site
on their github repo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
