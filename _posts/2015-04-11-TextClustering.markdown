>Anxiety is the hand maiden of creativity.
>-T. S. Eliot

The above quote I think sums up how I feel about my work and putting it out there for others to see. My anxiety when creating new
projects or trying to talk about something with authority to someone drives my thirst for knowledge and wanting to know I am
correct in my understanding of things. This also drives my need to build things on my own and try to implement things with my own creative twist
with the hope that it might be useful for others.

Now this blog post isnt going to be about why I do what I do but I wanted it to be an intro to something I started a year ago while job hunting
as a way to keep my brain active and not fall victim to complacency in my skills. So for this post I will try to describe how to do
simple document clustering using K-Means and K-NN to learn book genre's. This will also be a good test of how well I know this material, and
how well I can explain my understanding.
