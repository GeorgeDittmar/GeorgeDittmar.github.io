>Anxiety is the hand maiden of creativity.
>-T. S. Eliot

The above quote I think sums up how I feel about my work and putting it out there for others to see. My anxiety when creating new
projects or trying to talk about something with authority to someone drives my thirst for knowledge and wanting to know I am
correct in my understanding of things. This also drives my need to build things on my own and try to implement things with my own creative twist
with the hope that it might be useful for others.

Now this blog post isnt going to be about why I do what I do but I wanted it to be an intro to something I started a year ago while job hunting
as a way to keep my brain active and not fall victim to complacency in my skills. So for the next series of posts I will try to describe how to do
simple document clustering using K-Means and K-NN to learn book genre's. This will also be a good test of how well I know this material, and
how well I can explain my understanding.

First I'll give a basic definition of what problem we are wanting to solve and the setup of the the data. Secondly I'll discuss the algorithms
being used, hopefully with useful citations, that will give some validity to what I am talking about. I am still working out if this will be a
single blog post or multiple smaller posts. I guess we shall see how things go and hopefully this will keep me wanting to post more as I learn new things
or work on things.
