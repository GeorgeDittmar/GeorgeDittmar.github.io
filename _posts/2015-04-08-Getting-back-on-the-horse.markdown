Its time to get serious about where I want to move my career and keep my research skills fresh. Thats why I am attempting to get
back on the Machine Learning horse. Most of this has to do with wanting to expand my employable skill sets but also really
dive into the problems I want to solve now with big data and its application to the ML research field. With the explosion in the
popularity of ML the last 5 years with online MOOCS and roles such as Data Science being found at jobs all over, its hard not to want to get back in on the action! 
I really need to get my focus back to my research roots in ML and just build cool and interesting things that can hopefully expand into work with my current
company or with others. Who knows but now that there are so many tools and resources out there it seems crazy not to try to 
do some self study and research these days.

Current goals will focus around brushing up on my background mathematics that have gotten rusty and their application in
solving many ML algorithms. Hoping to make this blog a nice journal / portfolio of my work towards getting myself where I want
to be and maybe I can teach some other people some stuff as I go through these problems again. One can hope at least :)

Plan of attack is work on my [Scala Neural Net project](https://github.com/GeorgeDittmar/Scala-NeuralNet), brush up on Linear Algebra and Stats, and build out a reddit bot with a collegue of mine.
Sure is going to be bunch of work but it should be fun. Thats why we are the mad scientists right?
