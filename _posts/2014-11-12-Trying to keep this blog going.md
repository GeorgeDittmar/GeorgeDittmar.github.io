I have kept hearing about how fun it is to blog by using jekyll and github and I finally decided to take the dive and do it.
This will be the first in what I hope are a series of blog posts on my life in Portland, Big Data, and Machine Learning. Hopefully
it wont be too boring but will be interesting. As well this space will be a place for me to talk about what I am currently working
on and interested in.

Heres to hopefully keeping this up!
